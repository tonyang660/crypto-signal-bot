## Active Signal Monitoring

The bot **continuously monitors active signals even when trading is disabled** for the day (e.g., due to daily loss limits or consecutive losses). This ensures:

- ✅ Take profit targets are always monitored
- ✅ Stop losses are always enforced
- ✅ Signals are properly closed when TP/SL is hit
- ✅ Performance tracking remains accurate

**To check your active signals at any time:**
```bash
python check_signals.py
```

This displays:
- Current price vs entry price
- Distance to stop loss
- Distance to each take profit level
- Realized and unrealized P&L
- Position size and duration

## Risk Management

- **Max risk per trade:** 1% ($20 on $2000 account)
- **Consecutive loss protection:** 3 losses triggers 4-hour cooldown ⭐ PRIMARY
- **Max weekly loss:** 6% ($120) - Hard stop for the week
- **Max leverage:** 3× effective
- **Max active signals:** 3 total, 1 per pair, 1 BTC max

**Note:** Daily loss limit removed in favor of consecutive loss cooldown, which is more responsive to actual trading conditions.

## Signal Rules

✅ **Creates signal when:**
- HTF trend aligns with direction
- Volatility within acceptable range (0.7-2.0× avg ATR)
- **MACD momentum confirms direction AND is strengthening** ⭐ NEW
- Price near EMA21 pullback
- **Clear distance from recent swing highs/lows (0.5× ATR minimum)** ⭐ NEW
- Volume above average
- Signal score ≥ 70 (or 85 during drawdown)

🛑 **Closes signal when:**
- TP1 hit (closes 50%)
- TP2 hit (closes 30%)
- TP3 hit (closes remaining 20%)
- Stop loss hit (closes all - now 2.0× ATR for better survivability) ⭐ IMPROVED
